        <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>

        <p>A <span>croissant</span> is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
            Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.Croissants are
            named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
            in
            succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
            layered, flaky texture,
            similar to a puff pastry.</p>
        <h2>Did you know that..</h2>
        <p>The kipferl, the origin of croissant, can be dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria, and came in
            various shapes.The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a
            form
            of kipferl). The birth of the croissant itself—that is, its adaptation from the plainer form of kipferl,
            before the
            invention ofviennoiseries—can be dated to at least 1839 (some say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer,
            August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.This
            bakery, which served
            Viennese specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French
            imitators
            (and the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style
            pastries). The
            French versionof the kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant) shape and has become a universally
            identifiable shape
            across the world.</p>
